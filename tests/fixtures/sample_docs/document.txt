Introduction to Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings are numerical representations of data like text, images, or audio that capture semantic meaning.

Key Concepts

Embeddings are dense vector representations of data in a continuous space. Similar items are positioned close to each other in this vector space, enabling similarity searches.

Similarity Search

The primary operation in vector databases is similarity search, also known as nearest neighbor search. Given a query vector, the database finds the most similar vectors based on distance metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

Use Cases

Vector databases power many modern AI applications:
- Semantic search engines
- Recommendation systems
- Image similarity search
- Question answering systems
- Anomaly detection

Common vector database solutions include ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, and Qdrant. Each offers different trade-offs in terms of performance, scalability, and features.

Performance Considerations

Vector databases use specialized indexing techniques like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) or IVF (Inverted File Index) to enable fast approximate nearest neighbor search even with millions of vectors.

Conclusion

Vector databases are essential infrastructure for building AI-powered applications that require semantic understanding and similarity-based retrieval.
